<p>I grew up north of Auckland, New Zealand on a beef farm in a place called Dairy Flat. Imagine how the childhood of young Daisy-beef-farmer-from-Dairy-Flat was full of cow-themed jokes! It was wonderful though, lots of nature, heaps of room to play with my brother and I know how to rear calves and skin rabbits and dig drains. I enjoyed living there up until I was about 14, when I wanted to go out and be naughty and drink booze and meet boys.</p>

<p>Because I could not get out of my house to be baddass, I took up a number of old-lady hobbies. I learnt how to paint, knit and sew, I studied opera singing, became thrilled by gardening and went on stupidly big walks. Last year I decided I should get out of New Zealand to discover new and exciting things, so I moved to London. </p>
